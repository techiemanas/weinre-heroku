weinre-heroku - heroku wrapper around weinre
============================================

If you'd like to run your very own weinre server on
the big ol' internets, this project is for you.

You'll need some
[basic familiarity](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs)
with
[heroku](http://www.heroku.com/).

Here are the basic instructions:

<pre>
<b>$ git clone git://github.com/techiemanas/weinre-heroku.git</b>

                                             &nbsp;
<b>$ heroku ps:scale web=1</b>
Scaling web processes... done, now running 1
                                             &nbsp;
<b>$ heroku ps</b>
=== web: `node node_modules/.bin/weinre --httpPort $PORT --boundHost -all- --verbose`

                                             &nbsp;
<b>$ heroku open</b>
Opening aaa-bbb-666... done
</pre>

At this point, a browser has opened to your instance of weinre on the big ol'
internets.

Enjoy!


running on Cloud Foundry
============================================

It's even easier to run weinre on Cloud Foundry than it is on Heroku!

Assumes you have an account on a Cloud Foundry-based PaaS, and have the 
[`cf` tool](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) installed.

If you're not currently using Cloud Foundry, you can try out
[IBM's BlueMix](https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/) for free.

Here are the basic instructions:

* note that you should substitute your own desired hostname in the `-n` option of 
  the `cf push weinre` invocation below.

<b>$ git clone git://github.com/pmuellr/weinre-heroku.git</b>

                                             &nbsp;
<b>$ cd weinre-heroku</b>
                                             &nbsp;
